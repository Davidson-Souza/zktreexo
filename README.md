## RISC-0 utreexo proof verification

> ** Do not use this in serious stuff, I don't know what I'm doing.

This is a minimal zk implementation for Utreexo proofs. It let's you prove that a UTXO exists in the 
UTXO set, without reveling which UTXO is being proved. It **does not** prove possesion over the UTXO,
therefore, anyone can prove any UTXO.
